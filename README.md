## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BootStrap5
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My main aim was to practice and garner some skills in Bootstrap and I was able to learn a lot about BootStrap cards and alignment of the elements using the classes. It significantly helped reduce the length of my code and I feel much more comfortable and positive using BootStrap. 

### Useful resources

- BootStrap mn documentations were a great help and guide throughout this whole journey
